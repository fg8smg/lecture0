<h2 class="c1"> Importance of a balanced diet </h2>
<div> <p> Nowadays, people are not taking a balanced diet rather eating all sorts of harmful foods. We cannot expect our body to stay fit by doing exercise only. A balanced diet is very important to achieve the goal. Therefore, it is more important of having a balanced diet in daily life. A 'balanced' diet requires all the foods to be eaten in a balanced manner. For example, it will not be considered as a balanced diet if we consume large amounts of fats and a little amount of protein, eventhough we are eating the right foods. The balance needs to be maintained for that. <div> </p>
